# Module 6: Monitoring, Observability & CI/CD

**Master production monitoring and automation - Essential for maintaining ML systems at scale.**

---

## 🎯 Module Overview

**Duration**: 4 weeks  
**Difficulty**: Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: Modules 1-5, production system experience

**The Final Frontier**: ML systems fail silently in production. This module teaches you to:
- Detect model degradation before it impacts business
- Build automated ML pipelines with CI/CD
- Implement industry-standard monitoring

**Interview Edge**: Understanding monitoring and automation shows production maturity - a key differentiator for senior roles.

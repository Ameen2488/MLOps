                "#### Q2: \"When would you use Random Undersampling over SMOTE?\"\n",
                "**Answer**: \"If I have massive data (e.g., 100 million negative clicks vs 1 million positive clicks), SMOTE is computationally expensive (O(N^2) or KNN based). Undersampling reduces the data size, making training feasible, and with 1 million positives, I simpler methods work fine.\"\n",

                "#### Q3: \"Should I resample the Test set?\"\n",

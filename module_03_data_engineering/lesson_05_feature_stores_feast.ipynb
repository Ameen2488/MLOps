                "#### Q1: \"Why do we need an Online AND Offline store?\"\n",
                "**Answer**: \"They serve different needs. The Offline store (S3) is optimized for scanning huge datasets for training (Throughput). The Online store (Redis) is optimized for single-record lookups for serving (Latency). Feast syncs data from Offline to Online automatically.\"\n",
                "\n",
                "#### Q2: \"What is Point-in-Time Correctness?\"\n",
                "**Answer**: \"It ensures that for every training example, we join feature values that were known *at that specific timestamp*, avoiding future leakage. A standard SQL JOIN often fails this if features are updated in place.\"\n",
                "\n",
                "#### Q3: \"How do you share features across teams?\"\n",
                "**Answer**: \"Through the Feature Registry. Team A defines `driver_stats`. Team B working on a different model can discover `driver_stats` in the registry and reuse them without re-engineering the pipeline.\""
